    <h2 class="txt">Early life and career</h2>
    <p class="par">Bob Marley was born Febuary 6, 1945 on the farm of his maternal grandfather in Nine Mile, Saint Ann Parish, Jamaica, to Norval Sinclair Marley (1885-1955) and Cedella Booker (1926-2008). Norval Marley was a white Jmaican originally from Sussex, ENgland, whose family claimed Syrian Jewish origins. Norval claimed to have been a captain in the Royal Marines; at the time of his marriage to Cedella Booker, an Afro-Jamaican then 18 years old, he was employed as a plantaiton overseer.</p>

    <h2 class="tt">Musical Career</h2>
    <p class="par">In Febuary 1962, Marley recorded four songs, "Judge Not," "oOne Cup of Coffee," "Do You Still Love Me?" and "Terror," at Federal Studios for local music product Leslie Kong. Three of the songs were released on Beverley's with "One Cup of Coffee," being released under the pseudonym Bobby Martell."</p>
    <h2 class="tx">Illness and Death</h2>
    <p class="par">In July 1977, Marley was found to have a type of malignant melanoma under the nail of a toe. Contrary of urban legend, this lesion was not primarily caused by an injury during a football match that year but was instead a symptom of already-existing cancer. Marley turned down his doctors' advice to have his toe amputated (which would hace hindered his performing career), citing his religious beliefs, and instead, the nail and nail bead were removed and a skin graft was taken from his thigh to cover the area.</p>
